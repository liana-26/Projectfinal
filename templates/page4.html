        <h2>Why It Matters?</h2>
        <p>Sports offer a unique set of benefits for girls, extending far beyond physical fitness. They promote:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Physical Health & Well-being: Regular participation in sports helps combat childhood obesity, improve cardiovascular health, and build strength and endurance.</li>
            <li>Confidence and Self-esteem: Girls who engage in sports experience increased self-confidence, learning how to overcome challenges, set goals, and achieve success.</li>
            <li>Social Skills & Leadership: Team sports foster communication, teamwork, and leadership skills, helping girls navigate social situations and become natural leaders.</li>
            <li>Mental Resilience: Sports teach girls to handle setbacks and persevere under pressure, skills that are crucial for personal growth and success in all areas of life.</li>
            <li>Breaking Gender Stereotypes: Engaging in sports challenges traditional gender roles, showing girls they can excel in areas historically dominated by men.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sports have the power to transform lives, especially for young girls. Participation in sports not only promotes physical health but also builds mental resilience, confidence, and leadership skills. For girls, sports provide a platform to challenge societal norms, develop teamwork, and break barriers. However, girls often face unique challenges in sports, including limited access to training, fewer role models, and the pressure to conform to traditional gender roles.<br>By empowering girls to participate in sports, we are providing them with tools to succeed not only in athletics but in life. Through our Girls in Sports Initiative, we aim to eliminate these barriers, ensuring every girl has the opportunity to experience the transformative power of sports.</p>

            <li><strong>Sofia Alvarez (Soccer):</strong>
                Sofia grew up in a small town where girls weren’t encouraged to play sports.

Today, she’s playing professionally, using her platform to inspire young girls in her community to play sports and break barriers.</li>
            <li><strong>Maya Jansen (Track & Field):</strong>
                Maya faced financial challenges while pursuing her dream of competing at the national level.
