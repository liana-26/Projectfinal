I made this website for my final project because, according to me, girls must participate more in sports to change the staggering difference in the number of men and women participating in sports and athletics. This website when fully functional, soon will allow girls and boys alike to access guides to important skills for any sport possible and speak to or get mentored by coaches.

}

    display: flex;
    overflow: hidden;
    width: 300vw;
    transition: transform 0.5s ease-in-out;
}

.banner-item {
    width: 100vw;
    flex-shrink: 0;
}
<script>
    const banners = document.querySelectorAll('.banner-item');
    const totalBanners = banners.length / 2; // Since we duplicated the items
    let index = 0;
    
    setInterval(function() {
        index++;
        const transformValue = `translateX(-${index * 100 / totalBanners}%)`;
        document.querySelector('.banner-container').style.transform = transformValue;
        if (index === totalBanners) {
            setTimeout(() => {
                document.querySelector('.banner-container').style.transition = 'none';
                document.querySelector('.banner-container').style.transform = 'translateX(0)';
                index = 0;
                setTimeout(() => {
                    document.querySelector('.banner-container').style.transition = 'transform 0.5s ease-in-out';
                }, 50);

### style.css
- was very  helpful as it created for the webpage a user friendly interface.
Every website page has a menu bar that opens upon clicking â˜° at the top right and bottom right of every page.
Using functions on and off in JavaScript and navigation class and overlay in HTML, was possible.
#overlay {
    position: fixed;
    display: none;
    width: -50%;
    height: 100%;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
    z-index: 2;
    cursor: pointer;
}gives a grey overlay

#text{
    position: fixed;
    top: 100%;
    left: 90%;
    font-size: 10px;
    color: white;
    transform: translate(-100%,-100%);
    -ms-transform: translate(-100%,-100%);
    background-color: #CA7B7B;

} 
Every page also has a footer with a "centered" Page no. .centered allows the page no. to be written in the middle of the webpage with a 1px dashed black border till both ends of the screen.
.centered {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    text-align: center;
  }

.centered::before,
.centered::after {
    content: "";
    flex:1;
    border-bottom: 1px dashed black;
    margin: 1px;
}
